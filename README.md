# Repository-Automation

## Overview

Repository-Automation is a data scraping and analysis project aimed at identifying potentially fraudulent claims. The tools used include Pandas for data manipulation, HIVE SQL for querying data, and Excel for data visualization and reporting.

The objective of this project is to automate the data scraping process, create a structured data frame for further analysis, and store the processed data in a Hive table for ongoing monitoring and analysis.

## Tools Used

- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- HIVE SQL: Query language for interacting with the Hive data warehouse.
- Excel: Used for data visualization, reporting, and presentation.

## Data Scraping and Analysis Process

1. **Data Scraping**: Python scripts using Pandas are employed to scrape data from various sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: The scraped data is transformed and cleaned using Pandas to create a structured data frame.
3. **Parsing Data**: The scraped code is parsed to put as different fields.
4. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in a Hive table for ongoing monitoring and analysis.
5. **Reporting and Visualization**: Excel is utilized for data visualization, reporting, and presenting insights derived from the analysis.

## Usage

As this project description is conceptual and does not include specific code, consider the following steps for implementation:

1. Set up Python environment with Pandas installed for data scraping and manipulation.
2. Configure HIVE SQL environment for querying and storing data in a Hive table.
3. Develop Python scripts to automate the data scraping process and create a structured data frame.
4. Store the processed data in a Hive table for ongoing monitoring and analysis.
5. Use Excel for data visualization, reporting, and presenting insights derived from the analysis.
